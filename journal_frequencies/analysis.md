## Shared Journals
There are 383 journals shared between the SSCI and A&HCI master lists, all of which the frequency of publishing was able to be obtained. This had one exception, the journal "ARCHAEOLOGY IN OCEANIA" is shared between both lists and has a publishing frequency listed on the website (as "Tri-annual") however, the ISSN on the website is listed as "0728-4896" whereas in the PDF it is "0003-8121". As the ISSN is used to match the results scraped from the website to the journals listed in the PDF master list, the program does not recognise that the journal is listed on the website and as a result reports that it was not able to find the publishing frequency of this journal. Further analysis of the journals whose frequency was not able to be obtained is required to see if this problem affected them as well.

A comparison of the publishing frequency for these 383 shared journals scraped from the separate SSCI and A&HCI webpages has shown no discrepancies.
