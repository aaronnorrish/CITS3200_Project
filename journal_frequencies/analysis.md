# Analysis
## SSCI
On the website, there are a total of 3346 SSCI journals of which only 3332 have a publishing frequency listed. The PDF master list contains a total of 3250 journals. Of these journals, 3227 are also shown on the website, with 3214 having a publishing frequency listed. Hence, the publishing frequency of 98.89% (3214/3250) of the SSCI journals were able to be obtained.

## A&HCI
On the website, there are a total of 1816 A&HCI journals of which all have a publishing frequency listed. The PDF master list contains a total of 1784 journals. Of these journals, 1771 are also shown on the website, all of which have a publishing frequency listed. Hence, the publishing frequency of 99.27% (1771/1784) of the A&HCI journals were able to be obtained.

A potential point of further research is into the journals whose frequency was not able to be obtained, even though the journals themselves are listed on the website themselves. Interestingly the number of such journals (13) belonging to the SSCI master list is the same as that for the A&HCI master list.   

## Shared Journals
There are 383 journals shared between the SSCI and A&HCI master lists, all of which the frequency of publishing was able to be obtained. This had one exception, the journal "ARCHAEOLOGY IN OCEANIA" is shared between both lists and has a publishing frequency listed on the website (as "Tri-annual") however, the ISSN on the website is listed as "0728-4896" whereas in the PDF it is "0003-8121". As the ISSN is used to match the results scraped from the website to the journals listed in the PDF master list, the program does not recognise that the journal is listed on the website and as a result reports that it was not able to find the publishing frequency of this journal. Further analysis of the journals whose frequency was not able to be obtained is required to see if this problem affected them as well.

A comparison of the publishing frequency for these 383 shared journals scraped from the separate SSCI and A&HCI webpages has shown no discrepancies.
