# Analysis/Accuracy
## SSCI
On the website, there are a total of 3346 SSCI journals. Of these 3346 journals, only 3332 have a publishing frequency listed. From the PDF master list, there are a total of 3250 journals. Of these 3250, 3227 are also shown on the website and 3214 have a publishing frequency listed. Therefore the publishing frequencies of 3214/3250 = 98.89% of the SSCI journals were able to be obtained.

## A&HCI
On the website, there are a total of 1816 A&HCI journals. Of these 1816 journals, all have a publishing frequency listed. From the PDF master list, there are a total of 1784 journals. Of these 1784, 1771 are also shown on the website and all have a publishing frequency listed. Therefore the publishing frequencies of 1771/1784 = 99.27% of the A&HCI journals were able to be obtained.

Between the SSCI and A&HCI master lists, there are 383 shared journals, for all of which the frequency of publishing was able to be obtained. This had one exception, the journal "ARCHAEOLOGY IN OCEANIA" is shared between both lists and has a publishing frequency listed on the website - "Tri-annual" - however the ISSN on the website is listed as "0728-4896" and in the PDF it is "0003-8121". As the ISSN is used to match the results scraped from the website to the journals listed in the PDF master list, the program acts as though that this journal is not listed on the website, hence is given a publishing frequency of "N/A". Further analysis of the journals whose frequency was not able to be obtained is required to see if this problem affected them.

A comparison of the publishing frequencies for these 383 shared journals scraped from the separate SSCI and A&HCI webpages has shown no discrepancies.
